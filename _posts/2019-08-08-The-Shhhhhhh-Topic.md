Hey Folks,

Let me start with a small story.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

Radhika, a software engineer by profession, gets married to Ashok, who works at a private bank in a metropolitan city. They were living a picture perfect life, until Radhika honored a baby-shower invite and went to bless the mother-to-be. To her astonishment everybody in the party were staring at Radhika, not because she was beautiful, but because it has had been two years since their marriage and they didn’t have a child yet. It was not envy or jealousy that would describe the stare, pity is the word that is apt.

Not even in her dreams she expected the embarrassment that was awaiting for her. Every single soul that she met, either asked her why they were not having kids yet, why they were planning or advised them to have a child sooner than later. she who was happy until that moment, became dissatisfied. Ashok who originally wanted to plan for babies after a couple of years yielded to pressure from his wife. They started trying to have a baby. After six months, as nothing happened, they approached a fertility center.

Radhika had googled a lot about infertility and had a list of treatment plans. Every visit she kept insisting the doctor on what to do, she was so impatient. After trying all the treatments, she gave up after 3 years. When they stopped trying for the baby and then it happened. She was blessed with a beautiful boy baby.

We all have heard of many real life incidents like these, but what we should know about is the do’s and don’ts. So in this article I’m going to elaborate about infertility.

### What is infertility ?

So here we are, we all know what infertility is, but, do you know that it is "the inability to become pregnant after trying for ONE year without using contraceptives for women under 35 and for women above 35 is six months". In India 12%  of the population are suffering from infertility that is roughly 27.5 million and globally 2% of the women face primary infertility (that is problem in having a first child) and 10% of the population are facing secondary infertility (problem in conceiving after having a first born child).

The women alone are not the cause for infertility. One third may be due to women, one third may be due to men and one third is due to unknown causes, including food habits, life style. I was shocked to know that 40% of the couples face infertility because of obesity!!! 40% - that’s a lot of people.

### Why should you never ask a person about having a baby?

A women’s respect in the society depends on her fertility - especially in India. Having a baby or not is their responsibility - why do you even want to poke your nose in it? When you have your own problems to deal with.. and why is a man not questioned about not having a baby? Do you even know what it takes for the women to come out of it? May be they were trying, may be it didn’t work. Like said before, why should we question their personal space?

### How does fertility centers make money out of it ?

Many fertility centers make use of the anxiety of the patients, rather than seeing them as patients these set ups (not all, there are really good ones too) see them as money milking machines. For example in Radhika's case she was the decision maker, but the doctor should have refused and asked her to wait and try for a few more months. And people, there is nothing wrong in googling and gaining knowledge but let your doctor tell you the treatment plan and you can always go for a second opinion. Google can never be your doctor.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

Last but not the least. It should always be making love and never making babies. Don’t stress yourself, go with the flow.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

PS: I can hear your mind voice. In the coming weeks I’ll be writing about the infertility in men and women so for now this is just the trailer, the main picture is yet to come.

As usual, keep spreading smiles, now and forever.
