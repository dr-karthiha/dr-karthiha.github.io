When at least 40% of the population keep mocking at this course I chose to be a dentist when I was 6. SIX!!! Yes, and here is the reason:

I met with an accident when I was 3 and lost my upper front tooth. Do you remember that dumb railway gate joke people used to make of us when we were young? Yes, I was subjected to it for a very long time, so at a very young age I understood the aesthetic importance and the role of teeth in phonetics.

OMG!! People say it’s just teeth and but why the hell do they constantly keep asking a child about their teeth when it goes missing?? At 6 I was embarrassed to even to smile to a picture, thank God I finally gained the confidence with the help a proper dentist and I felt like he was some kind of God at that point and that was the moment when I decided to become a dentist.

And the problem didn’t end there the tooth which came out didn’t have life (non-vital tooth) and it was discolored. Again came the problem, everyone started asking and made me feel embarrassed which only reinforced me to become a dentist and make kids smile without thinking consciously.

When I am finally able to see the light, the power supply goes down. That’s how I felt when my teeth was mal-aligned so I had to do ortho treatment to make my teeth look good. The moment I got rid of the clip I felt so good and I was up with so much of confidence and that, was the moment when I realized you don’t have to have a perfect aesthetic appearance but a dentist can make u look perfect.

That feeling of changing a person’s life made me to take up dentistry as my career and here I am as a DENTIST.
