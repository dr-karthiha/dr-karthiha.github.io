#### Why I became a dentist ?

When at least 40% of the population keep mocking at this course I chose to be a dentist when I was 6. SIX!!! Yes, and here is the reason:
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

I met with an accident when I was 3 and lost my upper front tooth. Do you remember that dumb railway gate joke people used to make of us when we were young? Yes, I was subjected to it for a very long time, so at a very young age I understood the aesthetic importance and the role of teeth in phonetics.

OMG!! People say it’s just teeth and but why the hell do they constantly keep asking a child about their teeth when it goes missing?? At 6 I was embarrassed to even to smile to a picture, thank God I finally gained the confidence with the help a proper dentist and I felt like he was some kind of God at that point and that was the moment when I decided to become a dentist.

And the problem didn’t end there the tooth which came out didn’t have life (non-vital tooth) and it was discolored. Again came the problem, everyone started asking and made me feel embarrassed which only reinforced me to become a dentist and make kids smile without thinking consciously.

When I am finally able to see the light, the power supply goes down. That’s how I felt when my teeth was mal-aligned so I had to do ortho treatment to make my teeth look good. The moment I got rid of the clip I felt so good and I was up with so much of confidence and that, was the moment when I realized you don’t have to have a perfect aesthetic appearance but a dentist can make u look perfect.

That feeling of changing a person’s life made me to take up dentistry as my career and here I am as a DENTIST.

#### What is dentistry?
Dentistry is the study of tooth and the surrounding structures. It is a five year course (4 years of study followed by 1 year of internship). Did you know dentistry is believed to be the first formed specialty in medicine?

#### Why do we need to maintain a good oral hygiene?
There is a story in Hindu mythology where Lord Krishna’s mother asks Him to open His mouth find out if He is stealing and eating butter, when lord Krishna opens His mouth, the mother sees the whole of the earth in His mouth. The same way when a dentist is looking at your teeth they come to know about your entire health system and your habits. Every disease has an oral significance so even before doing the blood work the dentist will have a differential diagnosis about your general health. Starting from simple fever to diseases like aids shows the early symptoms in mouth.

That’s why it is referenced as a double edged sword, general health problems may lead to oral infections and the oral infections may lead to general health problems. Hence Oral hygiene is very important. The significance of a regular dental check-up lies in the fact that when you go in for a regular check-up you can find out any health problems in an early stage and you can treat it early.

#### Dentistry as a career option:
I really don’t understand people say, “Huh, you want to become a dentist? There is no scope in it!!! Phew!!! Are you serious? There’s 32 teeth in one mouth and people still think that there won’t be a problem with at least one of those? Every person will at least visit the dentist once in their lifetime, so before letting those words again think twice.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

Everything has a reason, nothing happens just like that. There is a reason for dentistry to be a specialty. And to all the dentist out there, the society appreciates and needs your work, so, keep spreading the SMILES!!!
