## Reminiscing The Past... Believe in Miracles!

Hey Folks, Sorry for the late but ravishing post. 

I was waiting to write this post for the past 4 years, for some reason I kept pushing it around. So, here it is, the story of my little princess.

I got married at 23 and I knew I had PCOD. So, I wanted a baby as early as possible - as I knew it was not going to be an easy journey. Post my wedding we tried for 3 months and there was no positive result. I then scheduled an appointment with a gynecologist and got all the tests done. The tests again confirmed that the reason for the delay is my PCOD and adding fuel to the fire is I had hypothyroidism. I was put under medication for around 6 months. I lost hope and I told my doctor to start IVF as there was no positive news.

I used to take follicular study (from google: A follicular study examines the ovarian follicles using a transvaginal scan. The tissues containing eggs and the thickness of the endometrial lining are studied to determine the period that the patient is likely to ovulate.) every single month and end up getting a single line in the pregnancy kit.

My husband had to travel to another country so I was left with no options other than to go for IVF. But my gynecologist was firm in not proceeding ahead with it. I did my last follicular study in March (2016) and the result was no graffian follicles seen, devastated by seeing the reports I planned on continuing my higher education.

My husband travelled and being pregnant was the slightest thought I had as there were no graffian follicles. Just a week after my husband left I came to my senses that I’m late and when I checked there was this two pale red lines. We both lived in different time zones at that point it was midnight for him. I called him and told him that I’m pregnant he kept jumping up and down. Yes it happens when the impossible happens. I called my best friend she came home and with another kit to reconfirm and it was double red line again. Yayyyy!!! I called my gynecologist, she asked me to get a USG done and there was this little nugget with no sac as it was very early. And here we are celebrating her 4th birthday.

To anybody who asks me I would just say Believe! Miracles do happen. And post my delivery here I am with no pcod and normal thyroid levels. Miracles do happen. Just wait for yours and be ready to receive it
