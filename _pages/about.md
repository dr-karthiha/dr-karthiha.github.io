## Who am I ?
<div style="text-align: justify">
	<p>
  Folks, and for those that do not know me, my name is Karthiha. I am a dentist by profession, a passionate mom, an adventurist, and an avid foodie. I am trying to embrace the part in me that has fallen in love with writing, writing about stuffs that affect us in day to day life. I am a firm believer of the statement, “A pen is mightier than the sword"
